## Who am I?

- Data scientist / Methodologist Statistics Netherlands (aka CBS).
- Author of several R-packages, including `whisker`, `validate`, `errorlocate`, `docopt`, `tableplot`, `chunked`, `ffbase`,...
- Co-author of _Statistical Data Cleaning with applications in R (2018)_ (sorry for the plug, but relevant for this talk...)

## Data cleaning...

A large part of your and our job is spent in data-cleaning:

- getting your data in the right shape (e.g. `tidyverse`)

- assessing missing data (e.g. `VIM`)

- checking validity (e.g. `validate`)

- locating and removing errors: `errorlocate`!

- impute values for missing or erroneous data (e.g. `simputation`)

## Cleaning philosophy

- "Explicit is better than implicit".
- Make data knowledge as explicit as possible.
- Store these as validation rules.

### Advantages:

- Easy checking of rules
- Data quality statistics: how often is each rule violated? 
- Allows for reasoning on rules: which variables are involved in errors?
- Simplifies rule changes and additions.

## Rules

- Data rules are solidified domain knowledge.
- Real world knowledge e.g. :

      - `age` is not negative.
      - human `age` is less then `150` years.
      
- Expert knowledge, e.g:

      - `IF profit > 0 THEN turnover > 0`
      - `IF married THEN age > 16` 

## Rules (2)

A lot of datacleaning packages are based on explicit rules that data must conform to.

- `validate` to check **validity** of data
- `errorlocate` to find **errors**.
- `rspa`, `deductive`, `dcmodify` for **correction** and **imputation** using data rules.

## R package `validate`

With package `validate` formulate explicit data rule that data must conform to:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(validate)
check_that( data.frame(age=160, job = "no", income = 3000), 
  age >= 0, 
  age < 150,
  job %in% c("yes", "no"),
  if (job == "yes") age >= 16,
  if (income > 0) job == "yes"
)
```


## Data checking

- A large part of data quality assurance in Official Statistics is checking
data validity:
- $n$, number of records is high, typically > 0.5M
- $p$, number of columns is high, typically > 20
- population is diverse, different rules for different subpopulations.
- often many processing steps from input to statistic each checking/using (implicit) domain knowledge.

### Result: 

- Often many rules, great and small.
- Rules often defined multiple times at different processing steps.
- Rules may partially contradict each other.

## Why-o-why `validatetools`?

- We have package `validate`, what is the need?

### Because we'd like to...

- clean up rule set ( kind of meta-cleaning...).
- detect and resolve problems with rules:

    - Detect **conflicting** rules.
    - Remove **redundant** rules.
    - **Substitute** values and **simplify** rules.
    - Detect unintended consequences.

- check the rule set using formal logic (without any data!).
- solve these kind of fun problems :-)

## Formally...

### Rule set $S$

A validation rule set $S$ is a conjunction of rules $r_i$, which applied on record $\la{x}$ returns `TRUE` (valid) or `FALSE` (invalid)

$$
S(\la{x}) = r_1(\la{x}) \land \cdots \land r_n(\la{x})
$$

### Note 

- a record has to comply to each rule $r_i$.

- it is thinkable that two or more $r_i$ are in conflict, making each record invalid.

## Formally...

### Rule $r_i(x)$

A rule a disjunction of atomic clauses:

$$
r_i(x) = \bigvee_j C_i^j(x)
$$
with: 

$$
C_i^j(\la{x}) = \left\{
  \begin{array}{l}
 \la{a}^T\la{x} \leq b \\
  \la{a}^T\la{x} = b \\
  x_j \in F_{ij}  \textrm{with } F_{ij} \subseteq D_j \\
  x_j \not\in F_{ij} \textrm{with } F_{ij} \subseteq D_j \\
  \end{array}
\right.
$$

## Problem: infeasibility

### Problem

One or more rules in conflict:

- $S(x)$ always is `FALSE, **no data correct**
- _happens more often than you think_


```{r}
library(validatetools)
rules <- validator( is_adult = age >=21
                  , is_child = age < 18
                  )
is_infeasible(rules)
```

## {.plain}

\hspace*{-2cm}
\includegraphics[height=1\paperheight]{img/keepcalm-and-resolve.png}

## Conflict, and now?

```{r}
# Find out which rule would remove the conflict
detect_infeasible_rules(rules)
# And itś conflicting rule(s)
is_contradicted_by(rules, "is_adult")
```

- One of these rules needs to be removed
- Which one? Depends on human assessment...

## Detecting and removing redundant rules

- Rule $r_1$ may imply $r_2$, so $r_2$ can be removed.
- Simplifies rule set!

```{r}
rules <- validator( r1 = age >= 18
                  , r2 = age >= 12
                  )
detect_redundancy(rules)
remove_redundancy(rules)
```

## Value substitution

```{r}
rules <- validator( r1 = if (gender == "male") weight > 50
                  , r2 = gender %in% c("male", "female")
                  )

substitute_values(rules, gender = "male")
```

## Conditional statement

A bit more complex reasoning, but still classical logic:

```{r}
rules <- validator( r1 = if (income > 0) age >= 16
                  , r2 = age < 12
                  )
# age > 16 is always FALSE so r1 can be simplified
simplify_conditional(rules)
```

## All to gether now!:

`simplify_rules` applies all simplification methods to the rule set

```{r}
rules <- validator( r1 = if (age < 16) income == 0
                  , r2 = job %in% c("yes", "no")
                  , r3 = if (job == "yes") income > 0
                  )
simplify_rules(rules, job = "yes")
```
